##Introduction <br/><br/>
Here is a beautiful project was done with reactjs. I learned a lot from working on this website. <br/><br/>
I created the app to look just like Netflix, taking up all its functionality except the streaming part of Netflix.<br/><br/>
I used Firebase for the backend and Stripe for the payment method. I took advantage of the stripe extension on firebase which is a new feature of the firebase database to make payment smooth and running. Users authentication was made easy using firebase authentication and redux which is used for state management makes sharing data easy across the website.
